description: Execute research code inside isolated Docker containers for safe replication, experiments, and benchmarks. Use when the user selects Docker as the execution environment or asks to run code safely, in isolation, or in a sandbox.

# Docker Sandbox

Run research code inside Docker containers while the agent stays on the host. The container gets the project files, runs the commands, and results sync back.

## When to use

- User selects "Docker Sandbox" as the execution environment for replication or experiments
- Running untrusted code from a paper's repository
- Experiments that install packages or modify system state
- Any time the user asks to run something "safely" or "isolated"

## Running commands in a container

For Python research code (most common):

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -w /workspace python:3.11 bash -c "
  pip install -r requirements.txt &&
  python train.py
"
```

For projects with a Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t experiment .
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)/results":/workspace/results experiment
```

For GPU workloads:

```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -w /workspace pytorch/pytorch:latest bash -c "
  pip install -r requirements.txt &&
  python train.py
"
```

## Choosing the base image

| Research type  | Base image                                                     |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Python ML/DL   | `pytorch/pytorch:latest` or `tensorflow/tensorflow:latest-gpu` |
| Python general | `python:3.11`                                                  |
| Node.js        | `node:20`                                                      |
| R / statistics | `rocker/r-ver:4`                                               |
| Julia          | `julia:1.10`                                                   |
| Multi-language | `ubuntu:24.04` with manual installs                            |

## Persistent containers

For iterative experiments (like autoresearch), create a named container instead of --rm:

```bash
docker create --name <name> -v "$(pwd)":/workspace -w /workspace python:3.11 tail -f /dev/null
docker start <name>
docker exec <name> bash -c "pip install -r requirements.txt"
docker exec <name> bash -c "python train.py"
```

This preserves installed packages across iterations. Clean up with:

```bash
docker stop <name> && docker rm <name>
```

## Notes

- The mounted workspace syncs results back to the host automatically
- Containers are network-enabled by default — add `--network none` for full isolation
- For GPU access, Docker must be configured with the NVIDIA Container Toolkit
